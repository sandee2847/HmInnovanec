            <p>The success of any website depends on two key factors - its design and how well it functions.
               A good design is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and easy to navigate. On 
               the other hand, a website that functions well is fast, responsive, and error-free.</p>
            <p>
              The process of designing and developing a website can be divided
              into two main stages:
            </p>
            <p> 1. <strong style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Testing</strong>: This is the stage where the website
              is tested for bugs and errors. All the necessary changes and
              corrections are made at this stage.</p>
            <p> 2. <strong style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Delivery</strong>:
              This is the stage where the website is deployed. Both stages are
              equally important and must be given due attention.</p>

              A website is a necessary part of businesses, organizations, and
              individual professional reputations. A website is a reflection of
              what a company or individual represents. A good website must be
              designed and hosted properly to ensure that it is accessible to
              everyone and functions smoothly. This guide will provide advice on
              how to purchase web hosting and domain names, as well as how to
              maintain a website once it is created. <br />A domain name is the
              address of a website on the internet. It is what people will type
              into their browsers to access your site. Domain names must be
              unique, so if you are planning on creating a website, you will
              need to purchase a domain name that no one else has already
              claimed.
