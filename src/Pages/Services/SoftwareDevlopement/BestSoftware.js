                  Software development is the process of creating, designing, testing, and maintaining software. It
                  includes a range of activities such as requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and
                  maintenance. The goal of software development is to build software that meets the needs of users
                  and is of high quality.
                </p>
                <p>The software development process starts with gathering requirements. This involves understanding
                  the needs and goals of the users and defining the scope of the software to be developed. Based on
                  the requirements, a design is created, which outlines the architecture and components of the
                  software.</p>

          <div className="col-12">
            <p >
              Next, the software is developed through coding. This involves writing code in a programming
              language that the computer can understand and execute. The code is then tested to ensure it meets
              the requirements and works as intended. This process may involve fixing bugs and making
              improvements to the code.
            </p>
            <p>Once the software has been tested and is deemed ready for release, it is deployed to the end users.
              After deployment, the software must be maintained over time to fix any issues and make
              improvements as needed.</p>
            <p>Overall, software development is a complex and iterative process that requires the collaboration of
              many different people with a range of skills, including software engineers, designers, project
              managers, and testers.</p>
