            <strong>Need of Digital Marketing</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the early 21st century, the line between marketing and digital
            marketing has become increasingly blurred as digital platforms such
            as the internet, mobile devices, and social media are increasingly
            used to support the activities of marketing campaigns. The terms
            e-marketing and digital marketing are often used interchangeably but
            there are some subtle differences between the two. Digital marketing
            is an umbrella term for all of your online marketing efforts.
            Businesses leverage digital channels such as Google search, Social
            Media, Email, and their websites to connect with their current and
            prospective customers.

                    One of the most important aspects of digital marketing is
                    cost-effectiveness. With the right strategy, businesses can
                    save a lot of money on traditional marketing methods while
                    still reaching their target audience.

                    Digital marketing differs from traditional marketing in that
                    it involves the use of digital technologies and channels to
                    reach a wide audience. Digital marketing is an effective way
                    to reach a large number of people.
